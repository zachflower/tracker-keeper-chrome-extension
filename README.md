Pivotal Tracker is a popular project management application used by development teams the world over. This extension adds a sorely needed "mass-assignment" feature, which allows project managers to mass assign a group of stories to an individual project member.

This is an especially useful feature for small, efficient teams that divvy up a dozen or more stories per sprint to each team member.
